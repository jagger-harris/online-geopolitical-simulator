# Online Geopolitical Simulator

A simple geopolitical simulator designed to simulate basic country conflicts using a node-based system. Each country is represented by groups of nodes that are randomly generated containing country data.

You can view the simulation [here](https://jagger-harris.github.io/online-geopolitical-simulator/).
